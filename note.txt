We just published our local git repo
to remote GitHub.com repository
Few things happened:
1. It automatically created new Remote Repo
	under your GitHub.com account
2. Made the connection with your local git repo
3. Added all your commits to remote repor


Now our work will continue locally

1. Add a new file called note.txt
2. committed the change to local repo
3. we want this change to be reflected in remote repository so we PUSHED local commits to remote repository using push origin button
4. oberve it has been added in your repository under GitHub.com
